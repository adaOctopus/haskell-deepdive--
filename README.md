# Haskell Deepdive from First Principles
This is a repository of my deepdive into haskell via using First Principles book. After doing 2 courses in Haskell in University of Nottingham, Im diving deeper with this 2,000 pages book -> Haskell from First Principles

## Key point for understanding Monoid, Functor, Applicative and Monad is to start thinking of them as abstractions.
Defined operations and the set of types those operations can be applied to.

-> Chapter 15. Basically Semigroup is Monoid one leg off. Which is the requirement to fulfill the `Identity` law
Semigroups and Monoids are basically ways to express operations on a specific set/type
Think of it as a blueprint. Describing a behavior you want your types to have.

## Functor Laws

1. Identity

**`fmap id == id`**

2. Composition law

**`fmap (f . g) == fmap f . fmap g`** 
This concerns the composability of fmap. If we compose two functions, ùëì and ùëî, and fmap that over some structure, we should get the same result as if we fmapped them and then composed them:

Remember instances of functors expect higher kinded params as in
* -> * instead of type constants of type kind *

Here, functorial structure is the `f`

instance Functor (Two a) where <br/>
fmap f (Two a b) = Two $ (f a) (f b)

(Two a) -> is the functorial structure f
where data type = Two a b = Two a b ( but the functorial structure needs to be higher-kinded * -> *

`But remember`
Functor is supposed to leave the functorial structure UNTOUCHED and only ammend the within values
This won‚Äôt fly, because the ùëé is part of the functorial structure (the ùëì). We‚Äôre not supposed to touch anything in the ùëì referenced in the type of fmap, so we can‚Äôt apply the function (named ùëì in our fmap definition) to the ùëé because the ùëé is now untouchable.

Therefore we cannot touche the `a` as it is a part fo the functorial so we can only ammend the inner most value, thats why in tuples we only fmap the second value

instance Functor (Two a) where 
fmap f (Two a b) = Two a (f b) <br/>
`Example instance`

data Three a b c = Three a b c deriving (Eq, Show)

instance Functor (Three a) where
  fmap f (Three a1 b1 c1) = Three a1 (f b1) (f c1)
  
*Notice that whatever is after Functor in the instance aka the `f` functorial structure, it does not get altered* <br/>
Because functor is about changing the values of a structure, not the structure itself.
Completing excercises for Functor instances was super useful to understand how functors work. Change the values within a structure.

-> 17. Pending - Applicative <br/>
`Notes on Applicatives` <br/>

For applicative to work, we need functions inside some functorial structure
If the functions we want to apply are not in a structure, then we use pure f <*>
In that way the functions get wrapped by some structural context

## APPLICATIVE LAWS PRACTICE NOTES
-- APPLICATIVE LAWS<br/>

-- Define 1. IDENTITY laws and test their equality
law1 = id [1,2,3]

-- Functor
law2 = fmap id [1,2,3]

-- Applicative
law3 = pure id <*> [1,2,3]

checkIdent :: (Eq a, Show a, Num a) => [a] -> Bool
checkIdent xs = id xs == fmap id xs

runQuickCheck :: IO ()
runQuickCheck = quickCheck (checkIdent :: [Int] -> Bool)

-- 2. COMPOSITION LAW <br/>

pure (.) <*> u <*> v <*> w = u <*> (v <*> w)

-- This law is meant to ensure that there are no surprises
-- resulting from composing your function applications.
-- I.E
-- pure (.)
-- <*> [(+1)]
-- <*> [(*2)]
-- <*> [1, 2, 3]
-- [(+1)] <*> ([(*2)] <*> [1, 2, 3])

-- 3. HOMOMORPHISM<br/>

-- A homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures.
-- The effect of applying a function that is embedded in some structure to a value that is
-- embedded in some structure should be the same as applying a function to a value without affecting any outside
-- structure:

-- Law statement in code
-- pure f <*> pure x = pure (f x)

-- The general idea of the homomorphism law is that applying the function doesn‚Äôt 
-- change the structure around the values.


-- 4. INTERCHANGE LAW<br/>
-- We begin again by looking at the definition of the interchange law:
-- u <*> pure y = pure ($ y) <*> u

-- HINT: This is what I was thinking of , if it is possible :)
-- According to the interchange law, this should be true:
-- (Just (+2) <*> pure 2)
-- == (pure ($ 2) <*> Just (+2))
