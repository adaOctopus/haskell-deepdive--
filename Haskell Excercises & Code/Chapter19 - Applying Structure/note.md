## Chapter 19 I choose to skip
It is completely out of scope for my purpose.
I am learning Haskell to build smart contracts on Cardano using Plutus & Plutarch which are built on top of Haskell
Not to build Haskell projects.
For my purposes after completing all 18 chapters which are essential to building on Plutus
The rest of the book will be just about reading and becoming familiar
`Here the final chapters I will focus on`
1. Foldable - Chapter 20
2. Traversable - Chapter 21
3. Reader - Chapter 22
4. State - Chapter 23
5. Monad Transformers - Chapter 26
6. Non strictness - Chapter 27
7. IO - Chapter 29
