-- APPLICATIVE LAWS

-- Define 1. IDENTITY laws and test their equality
law1 = id [1,2,3]

-- Functor
law2 = fmap id [1,2,3]

-- Applicative
law3 = pure id <*> [1,2,3]

-- 2. COMPOSITION LAW

pure (.) <*> u <*> v <*> w = u <*> (v <*> w)

-- This law is meant to ensure that there are no surprises
-- resulting from composing your function applications.
-- I.E
-- pure (.)
-- <*> [(+1)]
-- <*> [(*2)]
-- <*> [1, 2, 3]
-- [(+1)] <*> ([(*2)] <*> [1, 2, 3])

-- 3. HOMOMORPHISM

-- A homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures.
-- The effect of applying a function that is embedded in some structure to a value that is
-- embedded in some structure should be the same as applying a function to a value without affecting any outside
-- structure:

-- Law statement in code
-- pure f <*> pure x = pure (f x)

-- The general idea of the homomorphism law is that applying the function doesnâ€™t 
-- change the structure around the values.


-- 4. INTERCHANGE LAW
-- We begin again by looking at the definition of the interchange law:
-- u <*> pure y = pure ($ y) <*> u

-- HINT: This is what I was thinking of , if it is possible :)
-- According to the interchange law, this should be true:
-- (Just (+2) <*> pure 2)
-- == (pure ($ 2) <*> Just (+2))
